According to these terms, each license permits the use of the plugin on a single end product, which typically translates to one website or domain. This means that to use the plugin on multiple sites, you would need to purchase separate licenses for each site. It's important to note that CodeCanyon does not offer a developer or multi-site license for themes and code items. Therefore, even with an Extended License, the usage is still limited to a single end product and does not extend to multiple sites."
